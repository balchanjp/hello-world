# hello-world
practice for github

Hi World. 
John Paul here. I am a musician, I play bass and starting to produce/compose my own music.
Ive put in a lot of time into learning how to code and I enjoy doing coding problems.
I do however need to put some time into learning how to upload these projects onto the internet.
